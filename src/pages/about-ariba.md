As an immigrant Bengali woman that discovered her profound hearing loss at age eight, Ariba focuses on advocating for diverse, marginalized voices that are often overlooked and ensuring we bring humanity into tech. After a varied background including Biomechancial Engineering, engineering research publications, and a stint at medical school, Ariba lead operations and product management for industry-shifting startups. This work and her passion for social impact brought her to the Ad Council as the Director of Innovation, where she’s charged with scaling design thinking and agile practices, creating digital products to create measurable social impact, and exploring future-forward technology for the organization. With over 10 years of experience in user-focused product design and leading workshops for entrepreneurs in global cities, she’s leveraging her life experiences, startup mindset, and scientific approach to create digital products for social good and organizational change, and empower an innovative culture. She is also a public speaker and enjoys dialogues on inclusive design, accessibility in tech, diversity to drive innovation, intrapreneurship, organization design and tech for social impact.



In her spare time, she teaches high school students UX design, go on adventures (climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro was her favorite), and knit more scarves than she’ll ever need.
